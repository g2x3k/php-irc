; some notes:
; the ~ operater spans definitions over multiple lines.  the ; operator
; denotes a comment.  it can be placed anywhere.  you must escape
; your single quotes in quoted entries with a backslash \. the first
; type of every statement is explained

; NOTE: as of 2.2.0, all function configuration was moved to specific files using
; the 'include' function.  General type definitions can be found in typedefs.conf
