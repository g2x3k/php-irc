    <title>PHP-IRC: Modular IRC Bot</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>PHP-IRC(this is running on php-irc http server)</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
    PHP-IRC is a modular IRC bot written in PHP5 with a combination of
    object based/oriented programming. It operates under several different platforms
    with the purpose of automating common information related tasks on IRC.
    There are two main reasons that PHP was
    selected as the primary language. First off, I wanted to provide novice
    programmers a way to code their own functions and abilities into a powerful
    platform without having to worry about such things as memory management
    and compilers. Secondly, I wanted to do something that no one has done
    before--create a fully featured bot in php. I don't know if I will ever
    complete the second objective, but I will keep on developing, as it will
    always be the main goal of this project. Nevermind the fact that I get
    constantly ridiculed by all my friends for doing this... hehe :)<br/>
